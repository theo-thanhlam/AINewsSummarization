        "story": "It was a memorial that Charlie Kirk would likely have enjoyed, one that delved heavily into politics, religion and the enduring strength and optimistic future of of his organization. The service, attended by some of the top U.S. political officials, including both the president and vice-president, covered a wide mix of themes. Many spoke about Turning Point USA, Kirk's conservative outreach organization, and how it will grow even stronger in the wake of his death. Kirk was described as having sacrificed himself for the cause of free speech, debate and the greater good of the conservative movement. Indeed, alt-right activist and conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec said Kirk was a martyr for western civilization itself. The memorial offered personal reflections of Kirk, an influential but polarizing political organizer in the MAGA movement who was killed Sept. 10 while attending an event at Utah Valley University. But it also seemed to be part spiritual revival and part political call to action, laced with some fiery rhetoric against perceived political enemies, while tempered with messages of forgiveness — depending on who was speaking. U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice-President JD Vance were among the speakers for the event, held at the 70,000 plus capacity State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., which was easily filled with Kirk's many supporters. In addition to the tens of thousands of people in person, more than 400,000 were watching live on Kirk's YouTube channel. Since Kirk's death, his podcast and social media feeds have attracted millions of new followers, according to The Associated Press. Thousands had flocked to the stadium in the very early morning, waiting hours in line hoping to gain entry to the event. Religion was certainly a key theme of the event. Kirk was an evangelical Protestant, and a series of top evangelical musicians performed. But many of the speakers, from Secretary of State Marco Rubio to podcaster Tucker Carlson, made the topic of faith and love of Jesus a main element of their addresses. Carlson said Kirk knew politics couldn't answer the deepest questions, and he believed the only real solution is worshipping Jesus and the only change that matters is repentance. Trump as well touched on some of those faith-based themes during his 40-minutes speech, which had some people, whose day had begun in the early hours waiting in line, heading for exits before he wrapped up. 'Martyr for American freedom' Like many of Trump's speeches, it meandered into a range ot topics, including an upcoming announcement about a new treatment for autism. Trump far exceeded the time taken by the other speakers, who kept their addresses tight and limited to about five minutes. Trump was the last speaker to take the stage, saying Kirk is now immortal, and a \"martyr for American freedom.\" He joked that he had at least one disagreement with Kirk, that the conservative activist preached to embrace your opponents, whereas the president \"hated\" his. His son Donald Trump Jr. got the crowd laughing by doing an imitation of his father criticizing his son for \"getting a little aggressive on social media.\" But he also riled up the crowd to stand and fight against their political enemies. \"Will you surrender? Will you back down? Will give up in fear,\" Trump Jr.  asked, to which the reply was a loud \"No!\" each time. Benny Johnson, a popular right-wing commentator and YouTuber, called for the Trump administration to carry out a \"godly mission of wielding the sword against evil.\" Johnson said the memorial wasn't a funeral, but a \"revival.\" Perhaps the most fiery of speeches came from deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, who took aim at perceived political enemies. Miller said that the fire of Kirk supporters burns with a \"righteous fury\" that their enemies cannot comprehend. He said they will prevail over the \"forces of wickedness and evil\" and that their enemies \"can't conceive the army that they have arisen.\" 'Love our enemies' That tone however, was in contrast to Charlie Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, whose emotional address was likely the most memorable of the service. She began by describing the horror of arriving at the hospital to see her \"husband's murdered body.\" But she also said she saw the faintest smile on his lips, which told her that \"Charlie didn't suffer\" and revealed to her \"a great mercy from God.\" And she spoke about forgiveness, most significantly that she forgives the person suspected of killing her husband. Charlie Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, says she forgives husband's alleged killer She said it's because of what Christ did and what her husband would have done. She said the answer to hate is not hate but love, and to \"love our enemies.\" Meanwhile, Kirk's own political influence was acknowledged. Kirk founded Turning Point as a grassroots movement to mobilize young, Christian conservatives. It became a multimillion-dollar operation under his leadership and has chapters on college campuses all over the United States. It was credited with helping return Trump to office, a point not forgotten by the vice-president. Vance noted that the whole Trump administration was in attendance, and it wasn't just because they loved Kirk — but because they know they wouldn't be where they are today without him.",

        "story": "Canada now officially recognizes the state of Palestine and is doing so with international partners to preserve the prospect of a two-state solution, according to a statement from Prime Minister Mark Carney's office released Sunday morning. \"Over many decades, Canada's commitment to [a two-state solution] was premised on the expectation that this outcome would eventually be achieved as part of a negotiated settlement,\" the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said. However, that possibility \"has been steadily and gravely eroded\" by several developments, including the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel, the Israeli parliament's resolution supporting annexation of the occupied West Bank and the Israeli government's restrictions on humanitarian aid. \"Hamas has terrorized the people of Israel and oppressed the people of Gaza, wreaking horrific suffering,\" the PMO statement said. \"Hamas has stolen from the Palestinian people, cheated them of their life and liberty and can in no way dictate their future.\" Carney on whether recognizing a Palestinian state is a 'critique' of Israel In addition, \"the current Israeli government is working methodically to prevent the prospect of a Palestinian state from ever being established.... It is now the avowed policy of the current Israeli government that there will be no Palestinian state.\" The PMO added that Canada offers its partnership in \"building the promise of a peaceful future for both the State of Palestine and the State of Israel.\" The announcement comes as Carney prepares to meet with world leaders in New York during the United Nations General Assembly. Australia, the United Kingdom and Portugal also announced on Sunday they are recognizing the state of Palestine. In avideo statement posted to social media, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government is \"acting to keep alive the possibility of peace and a two-state solution,\" adding, \"That means a safe and secure Israel, alongside a viable Palestinian state. At the moment, we have neither.\" Today, to revive the hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis, and a two state solution, the United Kingdom formally recognises the State of Palestine. <a href=\"https://t.co/yrg6Lywc1s\">pic.twitter.com/yrg6Lywc1s</a> French President Emmanuel Macron told Margaret Brennan, host of CBS News'Face the Nation, that his country would formally announce recognition on Monday. Carney first announced Canada's move in July and said recognition was conditional on the Palestinian Authority, which controls parts of the West Bank, making certain commitments. Those commitments include governance reforms, general elections in 2026 in which Hamas can play no part and the demilitarization of the Palestinian state. The PMO said that \"Canada will intensify efforts to support the Palestinian Authority's implementation of this reform agenda, on which progress has already been made.\" In a statement, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said recognition is \"another effort [by Carney] to distract from his record of rampant crime, costs, debt, immigration and job-loss.\" \"Conservatives will always stand for Israel's right to exist and defend itself, living next to a future demilitarized, terror-free, democratic and peaceful Palestinian state. Conservatives will focus on what is good for Canada because it is time to put our country first for a change,\" he said. Lametti says Canada will wait for international ruling before considering calling Israeli activity in Gaza genocide Hamas said in a statement that the recognition of a Palestinian state by Canada, as well as by the U.K. and Australia, is an \"important step in maintaining the right of our Palestinian people to their land and holy sites, and to establishing their independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.\" \"This important step must be accompanied by practical measures leading to an immediate halt to the brutal genocide against our Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, and to confront the annexation and Judaization plans in the West Bank and Jerusalem,\" it added. 'A necessary moment,' says Canada's UN ambassador In an interview onRosemary Barton Livethat aired Sunday morning, Canada's ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, said the federal government \"has decided that it's a necessary moment\" and recognition is not an \"impulsive decision\" by Canada. \"I think it's important for us to make it clear — including, frankly, the government of Israel — that we do not think that annexation of any other possible political path is a route that's sustainable or in the best interests of Israel or anybody else,\" Rae told host Rosemary Barton. The Israeli Embassy in Canada said that it's \"deeply disappointed by Canada's decision to acknowledge a Palestinian state in the current context,\" which, it added, does not bring home hostages, free Palestinians from Hamas nor guarantee a peaceful future for Israelis and Palestinians. Recognizing Palestinian state a ‘necessary moment’ for peace: Canada’s UN ambassador \"It only rewards Hamas and its sympathizers,\" the embassy said. \"We compel the Government of Canada to reverse this decision and support a future agreement developed through direct negotiations and mutual recognition.\" Avi Abraham Benlolo, CEO of the Abraham Global Peace Initiative in Toronto, told CBC News his organization is \"shocked that it just happened this quickly\" and that Carney is moving ahead with recognition despite the Palestinian Authority not meeting the conditions laid out by Canada. \"He's basically reneged on his own words and promise to Canadians,\" he said, adding that the Jewish community \"is feeling both very angry, very upset and also very fearful of what the future holds here in Canada.\" Benlolo also said the Palestinian Authority \"has no control over Gaza, and Gaza is still at war.\" When asked how some could see Canada's recognition of the state of Palestine as offensive, Rae said, \"Of course we understand people's feelings. I think it's also important for people to understand the need to think consequentially because there's no point in thinking impulsively about this.\" \"We all recognize the existence of feelings, but it's important for us to recognize the reality that two states is the best steps to security, both for Israel and for the people of Palestine.\" On Friday, a group of U.S. Republicans wrote a letter to Carney, Starmer, Macron and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese calling recognition a \"reckless policy that undermines prospects for peace.\" The Republicans also argued that recognition sets a precedent \"that violence, not diplomacy, is the most expedient means for terrorist groups like Hamas to achieve their political aims.\" Rae said he disagrees \"most emphatically with that view\" and that Canada's approach is not meant to embolden Hamas. \"This is not intended in any way, shape or form to change Canada's support for the existence and the security of the state of Israel,\" he said. The PMO's statement said Canada's recognition \"in no way legitimizes terrorism, nor is it any reward for it.\" The Hamas-led attack on southern Israel almost two years ago killed 1,200 people, including several Canadian citizens, and resulted in 251 people being taken hostage, according to Israeli figures. Israel's military response in Gaza has killed more than 64,000 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, while aglobal hunger monitor backed by the United Nationssays Palestinians in parts of the enclave are suffering from famine. More must be done, says Palestinian advocate James Kafieh, a lawyer and vice-president of the Palestinian Canadian Congress, said the recognition is \"wonderful, although it is 30 years overdue. But I think that it's a marvellous progression, even if it happens under the impetus of a genocide in Gaza.\" He added, \"There is not much Palestine left that the Israelis have not already effectively annexed, but this may mark the turn in Palestinian history that will finally allow Palestinians to realize statehood.\" Canada has not called the crisis in Gaza a genocide. Incoming UN ambassador David Lametti, a former Liberal justice minister, told CBC'sThe Housethis week that the government \"needs all the evidence to come in\" and be assessed before it makes that determination. Lametti also said Canada's determination usually follows the lead of a UN resolution or a ruling from the International Court of Justice. Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, UN inquiry finds A United Nations Commission of Inquiry in Genevaconcluded on Tuesdaythat Israel has committed genocide in Gaza and that top Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, had incited these acts — accusations that Israel called scandalous. Now that Canada recognizes the state of Palestine, Kafieh said, the next question is how the Canadian government will protect the area. He called on Ottawa to impose sanctions against the state of Israel, not just Israeli officials, asCanada has done in the past. Stephen Brown, CEO of the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said Canada's recognition is a \"historical day,\" but it comes with \"bittersweet reaction\" because Palestinians are facing \"extremely difficult situations, especially when it comes to starvation.\" \"At the end of the day, what matters here is this is a very difficult situation and the world needs to use every last tool in its toolbox. Recognition of sovereignty is one such tool,\" Brown said. \"Ensuring security is another tool.\"",

        "story": "When the mayor of Colwood, B.C., went for an appointment with  his family doctor in 2022, he was in for a rude surprise. The doctor was moving away. \"I was absolutely stunned,\" Doug Kobayashi said. Kobayashi, who's been mayor of the city near Victoria since 2022, could have waited for the B.C government to eventually step in with a plan to attract doctors. But he didn't. Instead, he stepped up with a solution of his own that could create a blueprint for other communities across the country struggling to attract and retain family doctors. \"Here's the bottom line — making it as simple [for the doctor] as possible,\" he said. Kobayashi's idea was straightforward. After talking to doctors in 2022 about what was important to them, many said less paperwork, more financial stability and a better work/life balance. Hear from Colwood, B.C., residents on the mayor’s push to bring in local family doctors Kobayashi's response: Make them municipal employees. This differs from the usual system where many family doctors in Canada are independent contractors and responsible for all aspects of the business plus seeing patients. \"As an employee, we want you to be a doctor 100 per cent of the time. No more administration, we'll look after this. We'll look after hiring your medical office assistants. We will give you a salary, a fixed salary. We will give you benefits, all the benefits,\" Kobayashi said. \"It's like we manage our fire department and our RCMP detachment out here. It's arm's-length.\" Colwood isn't the only community across Canada trying to attract and retain family doctors. Many smaller cities try to tempt them with the promise of cheaper housing or affordable daycare. According toa 2024 survey by the Canadian Medical Association, more than one in five Canadians — or 6.5 million adults — don't have a regular health-care provider. The latestStatistics Canada datafrom 2023 shows almost 83 per cent of adults have a family doctor — a drop from 85 per cent between 2017 and 2022. Quebecers fared the worst, with 75 per cent of adults having access to a regular health-care provider. Smaller rural communities often have more problems recruiting family doctors than their urban counterparts. According to a 2020 report from the Canadian Institute for Health Information, rural doctorsmade up eight per cent of the physicians in the country. But 53 per cent experienced burnout, often working in multiple communities. Kobayashi said he knew he had to act fast. Colwood, with its mountains and ocean-front views, was rapidly expanding, as people were moving into the area. Having access to family doctors would be a cornerstone of that attraction. He took his idea to his local member of the provincial legislature, who took it to the B.C. health minister at the time, Adrian Dix. Dix was intrigued. But Kobayashi said it was still unclear if it would work. \"We don't even know if this is a reality from a business case point of view,\" Kobayashi recalled thinking at the time. \"I've got to make sure I'm not breaking the Canada Health Act or the B.C. Medical Act.\" And then there was the opposition he faced from provincial bureaucrats who warned how difficult it would be to make family doctors municipal employees. \"I remember [hearing]: 'There's no way in hell' — I think that was the word that was used — that you're going to offer pensions and benefits to doctors. No way. It's not going to happen,\" he said. Still, Koyabashi, who describes himself as a \"pitbull,\" persevered. Once he and the province determined the clinic idea could be legal, it got the green light and the municipal council approved it. The Colwood clinic opened earlier this year. How it works When a doctor sees a patient, the city bills the province, collects payment and pays the doctor's salary. The city covers clinic costs — rent, overhead and staffing. Space from the pharmacy next door is leased, keeping costs down. Council allocated as much as $500,000 to set up the clinic, but Kobayashi says there will be no extra burden for taxpayers. \"We believe it is sustainable. That's one of the lessons we're learning right now that with the proper scheduling, we've proven that it is a revenue cost-neutral project.\" So far, one doctor is in place. Two more are expected to begin practising at the end of November, with the goal of having eight within five years. Dr. Cassandra Stiller was the first doctor to arrive with her family from London, Ont., where she was primarily practising sports medicine as part of a large multidisciplinary team. She saw first-hand in Colwood the impact of patients having no medical care available. This bold idea could change how cities attract family doctors \"It's been a bit of an emotional roller-coaster, as you feel for these people,\" she said. \"I'm seeing people who haven't seen a doctor in 10 to 15 years and they're presenting to me kind of for their first appointment. And we're either diagnosing potentially a new diagnosis of high blood pressure or hypertension, discovering a new breast cancer.\" The promise of the Colwood plan lured her west. \"The idea or concept of the clinic was that the city would take over all the staffing, rent, coverage, those types of things. And I really just get to focus on the patient care aspect. And for me that was really something that intrigued me.\" Stiller is part of a growing cohort of family doctors who don't like the burden of running a practice. According to the Canadian Medical Association,less than one-thirdof medical school graduates chose to specialize in family medicine in 2023. That's down from nearly two in five in 2014, with many doctors saying that balancing patient care plus the administrative burdens of running an office is too much. \"We can see some trends,\" said Steven Lewis, a health policy expert at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C., who's looked at the issues important to medical school graduates. \"There's no longer a generation of physicians that want to be so tethered to their practice 24/7.\" Stiller doesn't mind not being her own boss. \"I get a paycheque every two weeks, which is nice because then you can kind of have a bit of financial planning and stability in life.\" Sheila and Shayne Eldridge, 68 and 66, were among Stiller's first patients. Originally from London, Ont., they came to Colwood in 2022 to be closer to family. They'd been waiting nearly three years to get a doctor. \"It was like winning the lottery,\" said Shayne Eldridge. \"I started to cry. It was a very emotional experience for me to finally get the relief of having a physician to look after us,\" said Sheila Eldridge. Will other communities follow suit? The Colwood Clinic is gaining interest from cities across the country. Kamloops, B.C., is looking to set up a municipally run clinic of its own and will present a proposal to council this fall. Other cities are intrigued, but unsure. Cost is an issue as well a question of jurisdiction. Health care is a provincial responsibility and some cities told CBC News they don't want to step into that lane. One Ontario city that studied the Colwood plan carefully was Orillia, north of Toronto. It has a population of 34,000 people. According to its mayor, Don McIsaac, 12,000 of them are without a health-care provider. \"I always like ideas that sort of break the mould and take a different look at things,\" McIsaac said. However, costs to retrofit a space in city hall for a clinic would come close to $1.5 million. Council didn't approve the expense, so instead the city will hire a physician recruiter. Still, McIsaac is leaving the door open for a Colwood-style clinic. \"I think they nailed it,\" he said. \"We haven't given up on that idea and we're still looking for alternatives in terms of how to get there.\" Despite the growing interest around the Colwood Clinic plan, some doctors' groups are uncertain. Dr. Carrie Bernard, president of the College of Family Physicians of Canada, says the idea is an exciting one, but it comes with questions. \"The risk is that if it's just the community doing it on its own, would it be absolving the provinces in some ways from their responsibilities and would it enhance some inequities that already exist between communities at all sorts of levels?\" Kobayashi says it's not something every doctor will embrace. Some will continue to run their practices as entrepreneurs. But experts like Lewis agree that if the Colwood clinic plan spurs other cities to think outside the box, it can lead to solutions that can save people's lives. \"I think the lessons of the Colwoods of the world is if you build it they will come.\"",

        "story": "Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Andres Gimenez drove in two runs apiece as the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Kansas City Royals 8-5 Sunday and clinched a playoff berth. Toronto is the first team in the American League to secure a spot in the playoffs, returning to the post-season for the first time since 2023, and improved its AL-best and AL East-leading record to 90-66. In 2023, they were topped by the Minnesota Twins in the wild-card round. The Blue Jays also came into Sunday's contest with the best record in the American League. However, Toronto only had a two-game edge on the New York Yankees for top spot in the AL East. A division crown along with clinching the first or second seed in the AL would give the Blue Jays a bye through the wild-card round and home-field advantage in the AL Division Series. The last time Toronto made it that far was nine years ago. \"I'm just so happy for them,\" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said. \"It's hard at this level for everyone to put their egos aside and to play for one another. It's so cool to see these guys completely happy for one another when they get the job done no matter who it is. \"This is the most fulfilling team I've ever been a part of with different characters, different skillsets, guys coming together for one common goal which is what's important now. This is something you always celebrate.\" The Blue Jays scored three runs in the second inning on run-scoring hits by Gimenez, Tyler Heineman and George Springer. Guerrero hit a two-run double in the fifth and Addison Barger followed with an RBI double to give Toronto a 6-2 lead. After the Royals cut their deficit to 6-5, Ernie Clement and Gimenez had RBI hits in the eighth to extend Toronto's lead to 8-5. Toronto starter Trey Yesavage worked four innings, allowing four runs on five hits while walking three and striking out two. #TheMoment a dad was brought to tears watching his son’s MLB pitching debut Seranthony Dominguez (4-4) pitched 1 1/3 innings for the win, and Jeff Hoffman recorded his 32nd save of the season. Carter Jensen had a two-run double in the fourth inning, Maikel Garcia and Salvador Perez hit consecutive run-scoring singles in the fifth and Randal Grichuk picked up an RBI in the sixth to complete Kansas City's scoring. Michael Wacha (9-13) gave up six earned runs on eight hits in five innings with one walk and four strikeouts. Blue Jays trying to win first World Series since 1993 The Blue Jays locked up a playoff spot with a week remaining in the regular season after a less-than-stellar start of 16-20 in early May and trailing by as many as eight games in the division in late May. \"I remember back when we were in Tampa in May, we weren't playing very well and we got swept there,\" Schneider said. \"I think these guys did a great job of rallying around each other, but the turning point was really when we came out of Tampa and went into the Texas series.\" Playoff success has been elusive for the Blue Jays, who haven't won a post-season game since 2016. And, unlike the past three trips, they hope this year they won't have to play in the AL wild-card round as they try to win their first division title since 2015 as they close out the regular season with a six-game homestand against Boston and Tampa Bay. \"You could feel it with this group in spring training,\" Schneider said. \"I know that sounds really cliche, but when you get a group of men that are committed to the same goal, you can do things like this.\" The Blue Jays are trying to win their first World Series since 1993. \"Today we go back to the post-season, but the journey is not over yet,\" Guerrero said. \"We still want to win the division over the next six games. Since spring training, everyone has been together and when you see a team like that you start believing.\" Toronto snapped a four-game losing streak with Sunday's win, and after the game popped Champagne in the visitor's clubhouse in Kansas City.",

Occupants of a dozen residences that were forced to evacuate were cleared to return late Sunday afternoon. Thealertwas first issued at 12:59 p.m., warning that a wildfire south of Highway 1 along Range Road 40 was threatening residential homes, with winds coming from the west. Both directions of Range Road 40 have since been opened at eastbound Highway 1 as of Sunday afternoon, according to 511 Alberta. County spokesperson Sean Rooney said \"fire fighters still have lots of work to do\" and were expected to continue operating at the site into Sunday evening. Fire under control, no homes destroyed: MLA Cypress-Medicine Hat MLA Justin Wright told CBC News the fire is now under control, with no homes destroyed by the fire. Wright, who spent Sunday at the scene of the fire following the emergency alert, praised the efforts of Cypress County, provincial wildfire response teams, HALO air ambulance, local emergency responders and others. \"It was really a regional response to prevent this from being a much bigger disaster,\" he said. Cypress County has issued an Alberta Emergency Alert for a wildfire east of Dunmore.

        "story": "Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne says that \"Canada should be prepared for a generational investment\" as the federal government tees up its next budget, set to be presented in early November. Meanwhile, the Conservatives are waiting for clarity before deciding on support. \"This is like 1945,\" Champagne said in an interview onRosemary Barton Livethat aired Sunday morning. \"This is the moment where Canada needs to reinvent itself.... For me, it's more like a down payment in the future prosperity of Canada.\" Champagne has spent the last few days laying the groundwork for what is expected to be a costly budget that he argues is necessary for Canada to steer itself away from its reliance on the United States, which still has tariffs on Canadian goods. \"We need to make generational investments in order to be less dependent, more resilient and bring prosperity across our nation,\" he told host Rosemary Barton. \"People understand that a lot of the costs we have to incur is in direct relation to the changing world economic order that we've seen. Some of these things have not come by choice but because we needed to respond to support our workers.\" Carney’s 1st budget expected to include ‘substantial’ deficit Prime Minister Mark Carney said last Sunday that the deficit will be \"bigger than it was last year.\" The public hasn't had its eyes on the federal government's finances since December, when thedeficit was pegged at $61.9 billion. Asked whether the government has any guardrails or fiscal anchors, Champagne said the Liberals will balance operational spending over the next three years, and there will be a declining deficit-to-GDP ratio. The Liberalshave signalled they intend to cutgovernment operational spending by 7.5 per cent for the 2026-27 fiscal year, 10 per cent the following year and 15 per cent in 2028-29. On Tuesday, interim Parliamentary Budget Officer Jason Jacquestold MPsat his first appearance before the government operations and estimates committee: \"I don't know if the government currently has fiscal anchors, which of course causes the people we work with considerable concern.\" He also said that traditionally, \"all is revealed\" in that several-hundred-page budget document, but the government is not yet at that stage. \"And at that point, we will have a clear sense of what precisely the fiscal anchors are,\" Jacques said. The Nov. 4 date for tabling the budget is later than the government had initially indicated. Carney said as early as May that the budget would come in October, and a number of ministers had stuck to that date when talking about the budget in recent days. Champagne said that \"it was just a better date in terms of the parliamentary calendar so that we give time to parliamentarians then to be able to be in their riding. That was really in line with the work of the House [of Commons].\" Will the Conservatives support the budget? Conservative House Leader Andrew Scheer told Barton that his party \"looks at everything\" before it decides whether to support or oppose legislation — including budgets. Scheer pointed out that thelast Liberal election platformprojected the federal deficit would be $62.3 billion in 2025-26, and he believes \"it's fair to hold Mark Carney to the standard he set for himself.\" That Liberal promise came before U.S. President Donald Trump doubled his steel and aluminum tariffs from all countries to 50 per cent. Canada is the top supplier of both products to the U.S. Poilievre says he'll decide whether to support Liberal budget after seeing the numbers When asked whether the $62.3-billion projection is a red line for the Conservatives, Scheer reiterated that the party needs to examine the budget and \"make that determination when we can take everything into account.\" He also said Carney knew Canada's relationship with the U.S., knew that \"the flight of investment in the Canadian economy was already underway,\" and he still \"made that commitment to Canadians on that deficit number.\" \"I think it's fair to hold him to that,\" Scheer said. To get the budget passed, the Liberals will need the co-operation of other parties. On Saturday, Champagne was asked by reporters at a virtual press conference whether the Liberals were courting the support of another party. In response, he said, \"Canadians would expect this Parliament to work together\" and \"the last thing they would want to see is a Parliament which is divided.\" \"What we're going to present to Canadians is very much in line with what Canadians have told us,\" Champagne said. \"I would expect the different members of Parliament to send a message that we stand united at a time where we need to step up with character and ambition.\"",

        "author": null,
        "story": "Alberta's premier says her government might invoke the notwithstanding clause to defend laws affecting transgender people because courts may take \"years and years and years\" to resolve the issue, and she wants to \"protect kids.\" Smith, who made the comments Saturday on her provincewide radio call-in program, was responding to news that an internal memo from her government says it plans to apply the clause this fall to its three laws that police school pronouns, female sports and gender-affirming health care. The government's memo says it plans is to bring the notwithstanding clause proposal to cabinet Oct. 21. \"I'm prepared to go to court and battle it out. I think we need to. But if it turns out that the court process may take years and years and years to resolve, then we may have to take that measure in order to protect kids,\" Smith said, noting government lawyers are looking into it and a decision hasn't yet been made. \"Puberty blockers, by definition, stop the process of sexual maturity and it means that you're sterilizing children, and we're not going to do it.\" Alberta looks to use notwithstanding clause on 3 transgender laws The government passed a law late last year, but not fully in effect, which bans doctors from providing treatment such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy to those under 16. 2SLGBTQ+ advocacy groups Egale and Skipping Stone, along with five gender-diverse youth and their families, have launched a legal challenge against the law and it is currently subject to a temporary court-ordered injunction. Alberta is appealing, arguing the injunction was premature. Puberty blockers are given by injection to youth experiencing gender dysphoria, where a person's gender identity does not match the sex they were assigned at birth. The medications block physical changes such as breast development due to estrogen or a deepening voice from testosterone, and allow youth time to decide if they want to continue gender-affirming surgeries. According to the Mayo Clinic website, the medicine most often used for blocking puberty, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, don't cause permanent physical changes. The site says when a person stops taking GnRH analogues, puberty starts again. When granting the temporary injunction in June, Justice Allison Kuntz wrote that denying treatment risks causing youth emotional harm and exposing them to permanent physical changes that don't match their gender identity. The notwithstanding clause allows governments to override certain sections of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for up to five years. Smith has long downplayed a need to use it, although last December she said it could be used as a last resort to shield the health restrictions law. She appeared to dismiss the importance of the government memo when speaking about it on the radio Saturday. \"First of all, it's a leaked memo, so obviously somebody's upset about it, and so they're trying to make a media story out of it,\" she said, stressing children shouldn't be making such health decisions. \"If we don't think a 10-year-old can decide to sign a contract, to smoke, to join the army, to do drugs, to be truant from school, then they can't decide whether or not they want to have babies as an adult.\" The Canadian Medical Association and three Alberta-based doctors are also challenging the health law in a separate case launched in May. They argue the law violates a doctor's right to freedom of conscience.",

        "story": "Proposals to expand the Port of Churchill in northern Manitoba could bring an increase in shipping traffic and commercial activity — and some experts suggest that could affect the behaviour of the whales that are not only a major draw in the area's nearly $100-million tourism industry, but an important food source for some in the North. Johnny Mamgark remembers first hunting beluga whales along the Hudson Bay coastline with his father as early as 13 or 14 years old. \"It's part of our culture; we live on it,\" said Mamgark. \"Living up north is so expensive, the food we buy is so expensive — that's why we need to hunt to survive up north.\" Mamgark, who now lives in Winnipeg, is Inuk and grew up in Arviat, Nunavut — a small Inuit community along the western coast of Hudson Bay, about 260 kilometres as the crow flies north of Churchill. He's worried more shipping and marine traffic around the Port of Churchill would disrupt the beluga whale population in the area where his family and ancestors have hunted them for centuries. \"We want people to understand that we don't just kill animals, we're feeding ourselves and putting food on our table,\" said Mamgark. Manitoba Premier Wab Kinewhas promoted the ideaof a new or expanded port along the province's coastline as part of a major northern trade corridor that could ship commodities like oil, liquefied natural gas or hydrogen to European markets. The Port of Churchill, which is one of Canada's northernmost deepwater ports and has a brief operational window each summer, is owned and operated by Arctic Gateway Group, a partnership of dozens of First Nations and Hudson Bay communities. It'sthe only deepwater port with Arctic Ocean access in North Americathat's also accessible by rail. Plans for a port expansion didn't make the cut in Prime Minister Mark Carney's first round of five major \"nation-building\" infrastructure projects, but upgrades are expected to be considered for thenext wave. Until then, some community leaders are trying to figure out how the Arctic wildlife population could coexist with a major increase in marine traffic and commercial activity. Whales depend on sound The beluga population in the western Hudson Bay isestimated at 55,000, with thousands congregating in the Nelson, Churchill, and Seal River estuaries during the summer months, according to the conservation group Oceans North. They're known to mingle with paddling tourists in the Churchill estuary — part of a tourism industry in Churchill that contributes an estimated $99 million to Manitoba's GDP,according to Travel Manitoba. Roughly 30 per cent of those tourists are drawn to Churchill specifically for the belugas, says Brendan McEwan, president of the Churchill Chamber of Commerce. \"The amount of times that a beluga whale will create excitement, but also make somebody laugh, is a really interesting thing about the species,\" said McEwan. But the whales don't take as kindly to noisy ships. Marianne Marcoux, a research scientist at Fisheries and Oceans Canada, says that noise presents problems for belugas, which depend on sound for basic functions like detectingtheir predator, killer whales. The low frequency sound from ships can travel long distances, especially in quiet Arctic waters, making it very difficult for belugas to communicate with one another, said Marcoux. \"That sound can mask the vocalization of a whale and the sounds from other whales that you want to listen to,\" said Marcoux. \"It's not just noise at the port — there's going to be noise all around the shipping lane,\" she said. \"That's concerning.\" A1999 studypublished in the academic journal Marine Mammal Science found that in the St. Lawrence river estuary, beluga whales decreased their calling rates as ships approached. Another studypublished in the Canadian Bulletin of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences in the 1980s found beluga whales were \"extraordinarily sensitive\" to shipping activity in the High Arctic during the spring, producing \"alarm calls\" and rapid movements when ships were within a 40 to 55-kilometre radius. \"The Churchill estuary is quite short and quite narrow, so there you're going to get lots of resonance and lots of noise,\" said Stephen Petersen, the director of conservation and research at the Assiniboine Park Conservancy in Winnipeg. Estuaries offer a lot of benefits to beluga whales, Petersen said — the warmer water is more suitable for giving birth, there's a large food source, and killer whales are less likely to follow them into shallower waters. While he doesn't know for sure what would happen if ship traffic increases, his best guess is that the whales will leave the area if it becomes too noisy. This is one reason he and his colleagues started \"Beluga Bits\" — a citizen-based, non-invasive project that aims to monitor and track beluga whales around Churchill. The project could help encourage Churchill authorities to limit the impact of marine traffic on belugas during certain times of year, potentially opening a path to coexistence with increased shipping, said Petersen. The chamber's McEwan said there are conversations happening right now in Churchill around \"how to embrace more economic opportunity, while safeguarding the region's unique ecosystem and Indigenous ways of life.\" \"We want to welcome increased economic development, development that our economy needs,\" he said. \"But now is the time to ensure that we're taking the necessary steps and working on a plan to ensure that all industries are viable going forward, and that our Indigenous cultures and our species and environment are taken care of.\" Protected area proposal Another proposal to protect the ecosystem along the western Hudson Bay coastline is by designating anational marine conservation area. Efforts to establish one of the federally designated protected areas in the region have been underway for over a decade, according to Christopher Debicki, vice-president of policy development with Oceans North. The main benefit of a marine conservation area is that it would provide a management framework for monitoring the health of the ecosystem, he said. \"If done carefully, with good management and good monitoring,\" the potential expansion of the Port of Churchill \"shouldn't have an adverse impact on the beluga population,\" said Debicki. The next stage in getting an marine conservation area designation for the estuaries along the western Hudson Bay would be for Parks Canada to initiate a feasibility study. Mamgark, whohas previously worked with Oceans North, acknowledges that having access to faster shipments through port expansion could benefit surrounding communities. However, he's still worried about how it might affect his community's traditional way of life. \"This expansion, I think, is good for everyone,\" he said. \"It's going to create a lot of jobs for the people of Churchill, but it's also going to affect the people along the coast, the Inuit who depend on sea mammals for food. \"That's something we have to discuss between Manitoba and the Inuit.\"",

This decision needs to be strongly reconsidered.\" And simply: \"Boooooo.\" So why ditch the bottle? \"We do understand and respect that consumers have a preference, and for those who enjoy drinking beer out of a bottle, we know this news is upsetting,\" Moosehead Breweries president and CEO Andrew Oland said in an email to CBC News. Iconic Moosehead bottle getting canned The thing is, Moosehead appears to have a point. More and more Canadians are buying beer in cans. According to Beer Canada, a national trade association representing Canadian brewers of all sizes and regions, sales of cans have far eclipsed bottles, going from 53 per cent of the sales in 2015 to 77 per cent in 2024. But is that because cans are what Canadian beer drinkers want — or is it because more breweries are favouring cans? Bottles beat cans, beer sommelier says \"I don't believe it's consumer driven,\" said master beer sommelier Roger Mittag. \"We buy what is available to us.\" The Ontario-based beer educator who advises breweries and restaurants and created the Prud'homme Beer Certification — a beer sommelier program — agrees with those who say beer in bottles just tastes better. \"Bottles provide a truer experience based on what a brewmaster would want to experience because the bottle keeps everything really nice and clean.\" A big part of that has to do with the carbonation. There's a bit less of it in canned beer, Mittag says, because of the ways cans are packaged compared to bottles. \"You can eliminate most of the oxygen in a bottle and keep most of this CO2 in,\" he said. \"But sometimes with cans, it takes a little bit longer to put the seal on, and therefore, CO2 gets out and oxygen gets in. So for me, I think you get a cleaner taste out of a bottle than you do out of a can.\" But Mittag says the average drinker may not notice a difference. Plus, cans are easier for retailers to move, stack and shelve, he says, and they don't break, so there's less mess for stores to clean up. Cans also provide more opportunity for creative packaging and are cheaper for both brewers and sellers. \"You can pack a can probably two to three times as fast as you can do bottles,\" Mittag said. \"And it requires less people, so it's a much more cost-effective efficient way of packaging beer.\" It also does better on the shelf, according to Moosehead's Oland. \"Cans do offer superior quality when it comes to protection from light and oxygen — two elements that negatively impact the taste of beer,\" he said. Environmental consideration But what about the environmental cost? While reusable glass bottles are typically refilled 12-15 times before being recycled, aluminum cans are recycled after just one use. Some environmentalists say it's important to consider the entire life cycle of the product. A research centre based in Quebec called CIRAIG dida life-cycle analysis, comparing bottles to cans and found that bottles become more environmentally friendly than a single-use container after only six uses, according to Julie-Christine Denoncourt, a source reduction analyst at Montreal-based Équiterre. \"And we know that bottles are reused an average of 15 times.\" She says you need to take into account the energy and resources it takes to recycle a can, including transporting the cans to a recycling facility, which often means travelling long distances by truck. Aluminum tariffs could hit craft beer where it hurts: in the cans Tariff pain And there's another looming dent in the can business — tariffs. In June, U.S. President Donald Trumpdoubled tariffs on steel and aluminium to 50 per cent. \"This is the biggest economic pressure point that is about to overwhelm Canadian brewers if the current trade distortions are not addressed very quickly,\" said CJ Hélie, president of Beer Canada. Canada is a major aluminum producer. But for aluminum to become a beer can in Canada, it must be shipped to the U.S. where rolling mills turn it into the thin, flat sheets that are then sent back to can manufacturers here. According to Hélie, the tariff and the resulting uncertainty have driven up the base cost of aluminum by about 200 per cent. \"It's a little bit like a fear response,\" he said. \"People are afraid of that uncertainty around where that 50 per cent import tariff may go into the future.\" Inventory stockpiles mean consumers haven't seen much of a price increase trickle down to their beer yet, Hélie says. \"But the first wave of can cost increases, we started to see in the marketplace in August,\" he said. \"And then if that 200 per cent cost increase sustains itself for an extended period, well, eventually that's going to flow into the market.\" Bottles likely won't entirely disappear Hélie is hopeful that won't happen. But he doesn't think bottled beer will disappear entirely from Canadian shelves either. \"The Canadian beer industry back in the day was really founded on the concept and the advantages of the refillable beer bottle,\" he said. With the advent of cool graphics on cans, though — which consumers favour — and the freedom cans give to brewers in terms of design and efficiency, he does think the can is here to stay. Mittag, the beer sommelier, says he'll be sad to see Moosehead's iconic green bottle go. \"It is a part of the fabric of being Canada and understanding what Moosehead is,\" he said. \"I understand why, but I almost feel like we've lost a small portion of the fabric that makes up this beer industry.\"",

        "author": null,
        "story": "Fallout from a cyberattack that disrupted check-in systems at several European airports extended into a second full day on Sunday, as passengers faced dozens of cancelled and delayed flights — and the impact poised to worsen for at least one major airport. Brussels Airport, seemingly the hardest hit, said it asked airlines to cancel nearly 140 departing flights scheduled for Monday because a U.S.-based software system provider \"is not yet able to deliver a new secure version of the check-in system.\" The airport said 25 outbound flights were cancelled on Saturday and 50 on Sunday. Starting late Friday, airports in Berlin, Brussels and London were hit by disruptions to electronic systems that snarled up the check-in process and sent airline staffers trying such options as handwriting boarding passes or using backup laptops. Many other European airports were unaffected. The cyberattack affected the software of Collins Aerospace, whose systems help passengers check in, print boarding passes and bag tags, and dispatch their luggage. The U.S.-based company on Saturday cited a \"cyber-related disruption\" to its software at \"select\" airports in Europe. It was not immediately clear who might be behind the cyberattack, but experts said it could turn out to be hackers, criminal organizations or state actors. The European Commission, the executive branch of the 27-nation European Union, said that aviation safety and air traffic control were unaffected. There was currently no indication of a widespread or severe attack, and the origin of the incident remained under investigation, it said. While departure boards for London's Heathrow and Berlin's Brandenburg airports were showing signs of smoother arrivals and departures on Sunday, Brussels Airport was still facing considerable issues. Brussels Airport said in an email on Sunday that it had asked airlines to cancel half of the 276 scheduled departing flights on Monday, \"because Collins Aerospace is not yet able to deliver a new secure version of the check-in system.\" Cancellations and delays will continue as long as manual check-in is necessary, it said. RTX Corp., the parent company of Collins Aerospace, did not immediately respond to two emails on Sunday seeking comment. On Saturday, the aviation and defence technology company said in a statement that it was working to resolve the issue: \"The impact is limited to electronic customer check-in and baggage drop and can be mitigated with manual check-in operations.\" Brussels Airport said it nonetheless was able to maintain 85 per cent of scheduled departures over the weekend thanks to the deployment of extra staff by airport partners \"and the fact that self bag drop and online check-in are still operational.\" The cyberattack affected only computer systems at check-in desks, not self-service kiosks, airport spokesperson Ihsane Chioua Lekhli said, and teams were turning to alternative backup systems and pulling out laptop computers to help cope with the impact. The airports advised passengers to check the status of their flights before travelling to the airports and to use alternative check-in methods. \"Work continues to resolve and recover from Friday's outage of a Collins Aerospace airline system that impacted check-in,\" a Heathrow statement said. \"We apologize to those who have faced delays, but by working together with airlines, the vast majority of flights have continued to operate.\" A rolling message Sunday on the Brandenburg Airport's web page said: \"Due to a systems outage at a service provider, there are longer waiting times. Please use online check-in, self-service check-in and the fast bag drop service.\"",

        "title": "Canola farmers feel the pinch as tariffs threaten profits",
        "author": null,
        "story": "Canola farmers across the Prairies are on track to harvest a strong crop, but fear they might not see a big profit — if any — as tight margins are further squeezed by China's tariffs. \"It's a nice tidy surprise, I think, to see canola production come through as well as it has this year in spite of its challenges,\" said Rob Stone, who farms near Davidson, Sask., between Saskatoon and Regina. \"Not a gangbuster, but it's certainly not as disappointing as the crops of [20]21, '22 or '23.\" However, Stone said the success in the field may not mean much for his pocketbook. When it comes to cash revenue from crops, canola is typically among the most profitable. But that's taken a big hit this year. China, which slapped a 75.8 per cent duty on Canadian canola seed last month, is Canada's largest canola seed importer. Canada exported $4.9 billion in canola product to China in 2024, the vast majority of which —$4 billion— was canola seed, according to the Canola Council of Canada. China's tariff on canola seed, coupled with100 per cent tariffson Canadian canola oil and canola meal imposed by China in March, is the cause of much concern among producers across Western Canada. Canola prices dropped about $30 to $50 per tonne almost immediately after the Chinese tariffs were announced, said Derek Brewin, an agricultural economist at the University of Manitoba. The lower price means it could cost more to grow canola than producers are able to sell it for. \"They're in a tight situation. The thing that has been paying the bills is barely making any money, and so they might be looking at alternatives in the spring.\" Times are tough, said Davidson farmer Stone. \"Say a 45-bushel canola crop — if you're expecting a dollar or two per bushel to be taken over by the tariffs, that means $45 to $90 an acre on our farm, and so that really is the difference between profit, break-even or maybe a loss.\" Some relief from feds Earlier this month, Ottawa announced$370 million in new supportfor Canadian canola producers facing the massive tariffs from China. The incentive is meant to address \"immediate competitiveness challenges,\" the federal government said. It also increased interest-free loan limits for canola producers to $500,000, but those loans will need to be repaid. The measures are appreciated but fall short, said Rick White, who is president of the Canadian Canola Growers Association. \"We just didn't think it went far enough, and we didn't think it reflected the gravity of the situation,\" he said. \"We want to be prepared for the worst and hope for the best, but the announcement is certainly going to help in the short term, so we do appreciate that — but it all depends on how long China has us locked out of their market.\" Stone agrees that the government must look to the future. \"It doesn't match up. You're dealing with a long-term tariff issue with some short-term support,\" Stone said. \"It's a program that helps provide some cash flow to our farm, but I have larger concerns about: how do we pay this debt back?\" White and Stone are hopeful politicians can negotiate the problem away. \"We want the market back. We don't want support, and if we can get that market back in the short term, then we're not so worried. But if this thing drags out, farmers are going to need to be supported somehow to get them through this,\" White said. Stone understands it's a complicated problem, but his message for the federal government is simple. \"Fix it,\" he said. \"There's a lot of things that don't have a simple fix. And I guess it's my job, and I guess my opportunity as a farmer, to just say, well, fix it,\" said Stone. \"It creates a lot of issues for the farm economy, for the Canadian economy and everything in between.\"",

        "story": "Hello, royal watchers. This is your regular dose of royal news and analysis. Reading this online?Sign up hereto get this delivered to your inbox. Donald Trump's state visit to the U.K. may have given the U.S. president much — if not all — of what he wished for, surrounding him inthe pomp and circumstance of royalty. But the visit a few days ago may also have given his hosts — King Charles and the U.K. government — at least some of what they wished for, too. While there were protests, the two-day visit generally progressed without major gaffes, leaving the U.K. government to hope it will bear fruit for the relationship between the two countries, particularly in matters of trade. And in doing that, the visit reflected the monarchy doing one of its regular functions. It was \"kind of a commercial for the monarchy in the sense of it showed people what the monarchy does in the realm of foreign affairs, personal diplomacy and international relations,\" Justin Vovk, a royal historian and member of the advisory board of the Institute for the Study of the Crown in Canada, said in an interview. Trump rides with King Charles in carriage procession \"You can't tell by watching this visit if the Royal Family likes the Trumps, hates the Trumps — whatever their feelings might be — and that's exactly how it's supposed to be.\" Prior to the visit, much had been made of the fact it was a rarity: a second state visit for the same U.S. president, something no other president has received. It was a rarity in other ways, too. \"This was an unusual state visit in the sense that just having the state visit itself was the goal, and for that to go as safely as possible,\" said Craig Prescott, a constitutional expert and lecturer in law at Royal Holloway, University of London, in an interview. By all appearances, that seems to be what happened, Prescott said. He saw the visit as a \"made-for-television state visit for a made-for-television president\" that was all about the image and \"allowing Trump to be seen … in that very regal context.\" From the U.K. side, Prescott suggested \"we seemingly … wanted to do everything we could to do what the president wanted.\" In a sense, that's in the nature of a state visit, Prescott said, but it seems organizers \"threw out much of the template\" for how such events are planned. Sure, there is usually a carriage procession — but usually down streets, not through royal grounds well away from public view, as Trump had in the enclosed Irish State Coach. During any state visit, the invited guest will also inspect an honour guard, but this time, Prescott said, the honour guard was larger. And there was, he said, an extra military parade. As much as the visit may have lacked major controversy, there were awkward moments that raised eyebrows, particularly when Trumpdrew repeated attentionto the appearance of Catherine, Princess of Wales. Trump tells Catherine, Princess of Wales, she's 'so beautiful' Ahead of the visit, there was much interest in what both Charles and Trump would say publicly in their speeches at the state dinner. Both, it seemed, were keeping it safe. \"They played it very conservatively,\" said Vovk. \"With the King, not surprising. The monarch typically makes very generic diplomatic comments in these kinds of speeches.\" Trump, said Vovk, generally kept his remarks understated. King Charles, Donald Trump exchange speeches at Windsor Castle Charles's speech differed considerably from his speech from the throne to open the Canadian Parliament in May. That speech was delivered in the shadow of the threat of Trump's repeated 51st state rhetoric and ended with Charles saying: \"As the anthem reminds us: The true north is indeed strong and free.\" \"They were two different speeches for two very different occasions,\" said Prescott. \"The speech [at the state dinner] was designed to say as little as possible, it felt to me, whereas the speech in Ottawa was designed to say as much as possible.\" The speeches, Prescott suggested, show that \"the King of Canada can do what the Canadian government wants and the King of the United Kingdom can do what the government of the United Kingdom wants.\" The Royal Family, he said, has shown flexibility as it supports the government of the day in its objectives. \"Perhaps the monarchy was used as a bit of a sword in Canada and more of a shield here in the U.K.,\" said Prescott. \"But it shows that the monarchy can be used in both ways.\" Time for charities — and his father Prince Harry's recent time in the U.K. was in many ways dominated by one big question: Would he see his father, King Charles? (He did, for the first time in almost two years.) After Harry and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, decamped to California five years ago, they levelled a wide range of criticisms against the Royal Family and the institution of the monarchy itself in interviews, documentaries and Harry's memoir,Spare. But such criticisms were nowhere to be heard while Harry spent a few days focused on charitable causes he has continued to support in the U.K. \"It seemed to have gone as well as could be hoped for under the circumstances,\" said Vovk. Harry has long had an interest in supporting children, and his appearances included meeting with kids who have serious health problems. Much media attention highlighted a play balloon swordfight he had with a young girl. He also announced donations to a Children in Need project and Imperial College London's Centre for Blast Injury Studies. That contribution from the Archwell Foundation, on behalf of him and Meghan, will support efforts to develop prostheses for children who have been injured, especially in conflicts such as Gaza and Ukraine. \"It does point to the fact that he hasn't quite carved out the equivalent role in the U.S. — that we don't see him visiting charities as such in the U.S. very often,\" said Prescott. \"Maybe we'll start to see him in the U.K. more often, perhaps as a semi-detached member of the Royal Family.\" Following Harry's time in the U.K., he made a surprise trip to Ukraine — and quickly garnered headlines back in the U.K. when he told a journalist for The Guardian that his\"conscience is clear\"after publishing his memoir and that he didn't air his \"dirty linen in public.\" Harry's comment about his conscience being clear hasn't played well with the British public, Vovk noted. \"He needs to tread very carefully,\" said Vovk. \"And unfortunately, with that comment, I think it's revealing that he still doesn't seem to grasp the scope of his actions and the impact they have had beyond just him.\" Much media attention has focused on the possibility of reconciliation with his father and with his brother, Prince William. King Charles, Prince Harry meet for the first time in nearly 2 years While the meeting over tea with King Charles seems to offer at least a hint of rapprochement on that front, Harry isn't thought to have met with William. There is little sense of reconciliation any time soon between the brothers. \"Maybe it's a case of two steps forward with the tour in the U.K. and one step back with saying that [about his conscience being clear] in Ukraine, but that's the one step further forward than he was before the trip,\" said Prescott. \"These things can take time.\" But, suggested Prescott, \"nothing's impossible with the Royal Family.\" \"You know, we saw how Camilla was brought into the fold after [that] being … the very least likely thing that could happen, but [she] is now a full and active part of the Royal Family, and it took … 10 years.\" Honouring the late Duchess of Kent The funeral of Katharine, Duchess of Kent, a few days ago drew members of the Royal Family together for an event unprecedented in modern times. The service at Westminster Cathedral in London for Katharine, who was married to Edward, a first cousin of the late Queen Elizabeth, was the first Catholic funeral for a member of the Royal Family in nearly five centuries. A message was read from Pope Leo. \"The last time we had [a Catholic funeral] for a member of the Royal Family in good standing was … Mary Tudor in 1558,\" said Vovk. \"There have been Catholic funerals for members of the Royal Family, but these are ones who have been deposed and exiled, so it's not something we've ever seen before.\" Katharine, who died at the age of 92 earlier this month, was known for her charitable works and love of music. While generally a low-profile royal,one lasting public imageof her comes from the Wimbledon tennis championships in 1993, when she comforted runner-up Jana Novotna. Members of the Royal Family attending the funeral, which was private and not televised, included King Charles, Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales. Queen Camilla did not attend because she was recovering from acute sinusitis. \"The fact that [a Catholic royal funeral] is able to happen controversy-free really speaks to how much the monarchy's role and its relationship with the church and the public's view of the monarch as defender of the faith has shifted significantly even in the past 100 years,\" said Vovk. There was, however, some media attention focused on the attendance of another member of the Royal Family: Charles's younger brother, Prince Andrew. Andrew's reputation sank like a stone after a television interview in 2019 regarding his friendship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In the aftermath of that interview, Andrew no longer carries out official public duties. His royal appearances have been limited to private family occasions. \"I think it's clear that he is, in terms of the public face of the monarchy, persona non grata, but will attend family events like this,\" said Prescott. Vovk said he couldn't believe they let Andrew \"if not attend, then at the very least be publicly photographed\" at the funeral. \"I just really hope that somebody is able to convince the decision-makers that they have to distance themselves from Andrew, because the Epstein controversies are not going away, the quest for justice is not going away, and if they are not careful, Andrew could be the iceberg that sinks the ship.\" Royally quotable \"In fact, had the media succeeded in the 1970s in their own attempt at deepening the special relationship, I myself might have been married off within the Nixon family.\" — King Charles, inhis speech at the banquetduring the state visit by U.S. President Donald Trump. During the speech, Charles spoke of the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom and how he has, over 20 visits to the U.S., \"cherished the close ties between the British and American people.\" Royal reads Theseating arrangements at the state dinnerduring U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to the U.K. were said to be the work of that country's Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the royal household. Protocol has its place, but there is no doubt that Downing Street and the White House provided a lot of direction, adding to the intrigue around who sat next to whom.

        "story": "Anas Samir, a 42-year-old father of four, cuts a dejected figure as he sits smoking outside the shop where he sells groceries in the Palestinian town of Al-Eizariya, just outside Jerusalem. He has spent years watching bits of land Palestinians had hoped might one day be part of an independent state being lopped off in service of Israel's decades-old settlement enterprise. The latest impacts him personally. Last month, he and dozens of others along the main entrance to the town were notified by the Israeli military that demolition orders would soon be enforced. \"All this will go,\" he said, referring to plans recently approved by the Israeli government to expand the neighbouring Jewish settlement of Ma'ale Adumim in the direction of Jerusalem. All settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories are considered illegal under international law. But the planned expansion of Ma'ale Adumim is especially controversial, not least because the Israeli government has boasted it will bury the idea of a Palestinian state — as countries including Canadarecognized oneon Sunday ahead of the United Nations General Assembly next week. \"It is a retaliation, in a way, to the announcement by Canada and other Western states,\" Palestinian lawyer Hiba Husseini said in an interview at her law offices in Ramallah, a city in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. \"[It] sends a strong message to the West: 'If you recognize the State of Palestine, it's really irrelevant for us on the ground. We do whatever we want to do because we control this entire land.'\" 'They're not willing to even talk about a 2-state solution' The Ma'ale Adumim expansion will encompass a 12-square-kilometre patch of land known as E1 between the settlement and East Jerusalem. Israel captured East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan in 1967, later annexing East Jerusalem, in a move not recognized by the international community. Today, Ma'ale Adumim is one of the biggest Israeli settlements in the West Bank, home to some 40,000 residents. Its mayor, Guy Yifrach, calls the decision to expand it to include E1 strategic. \"I hope one day there will be an arrangement that Ma'ale Adumim will be a part of Jerusalem and the state of Israel,\" he said in an interview with CBC News. The Palestinians say the Israeli expansion will cut East Jerusalem off from the West Bank and further fragment Palestinian communities, making a contiguous state with East Jerusalem as its capital impossible. The E1 plan has been on the books for decades, but in the past the international community — including the United States — had repeatedly convinced Israel to shelve it. But the war in Gaza and support from the Trump administration have emboldened hardline Jewish nationalists in the cabinet of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly vowed to prevent a Palestinian state. \"Every decision, every rule, every step they make is designed to undermine the two-state solution,\" said Husseini, who was a member of the Palestinian negotiating team during the 1990s Oslo Peace talks, which eventually collapsed with each side blaming the other. She and former Israeli negotiator Yossi Beilin are still working on new proposals for a two-state solution, a joint project they call the Holy Land Confederation. \"It's designed for a period past Mr. Netanyahu and the extreme right,\" she said. \"Because, indeed, they're not willing to even talk about a two-state solution.\" Despite criticism that recognition of a Palestinian state is merely symbolic, Husseini believes it's still important. \"It's a shift. And it's a statement that the world is no longer accepting that Israel is undermining the two-state solution, is undermining the resolution to this conflict.\" Israel approves controversial E1 settlement expansion in West Bank Palestinians fear it's too late But many Palestinians fear the recognition comes too late, especially as Israel pushes ahead with what many call a de facto annexation of the West Bank. There are already more than 700,000 Jewish settlers living in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. In May, Israel approved 22 new settlements. Not all Israeli settlers are living on occupied land for ideological reasons. Some are there because housing is often cheaper and subsidized by the government. But violence against Palestinians by the hardline settlers — who believe the land is theirs by God-given right — has increased dramatically since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel. Between 2022 and 2024, the number of Palestinianskilled by Israeli settlers or forces increasedfrom 154 to 498, according to the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The Israeli military has also displaced an estimated 40,000 Palestinians from their homes in decades-old refugee camps in towns including Nablus, Tulkarem and Jenin. Israel has said it is targeting Palestinian militant groups. Many Palestinians living in East Jerusalem or the West Bank are reluctant to talk about their own concerns given the ongoing devastation in Gaza and the killing of well over 60,000 Palestinians there, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. But the horror of what's happening in Gaza also heightens fears among West Bankers about what might be coming next for them, especially given the turbo-charged feel to Israeli settlement expansion. An uncertain future Samir, the father of four in Al-Eizariya, has faced an uncertain future before. He lost his first business in Jerusalem's old city in the early 2000s, after Israel built a wall between Al Eizariya and Jerusalem. Israel calls it a security barrier, built more than two decades ago during the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, when Palestinian militants were launching a series of attacks inside Israel. Palestinians call it an apartheid wall and a land grab. With his West Bank ID, Samir could no longer travel to Jerusalem for his work. Now, he says, he's lost everything all over again. \"We don't know where we have to go. It's over.\" We visited a Palestinian village — then Israeli settlers showed up While he might welcome the decision of Canada and others to formally recognize a Palestinian state — conditional as it may be — he doesn't believe it will actually change anything for him or the Palestinian people. \"To Netanyahu, this is [greater] Israel, and so we can't live here,\" he said. Another veteran negotiator for the Palestinians during the Oslo peace talks, Khalil Toufakji, says as things stand now, a viable Palestinian state is simply impossible. \"It's like Swiss cheese,\" he said describing the various cantons into which Palestinians have been divided by Israeli checkpoints, appropriated land, barriers and bypass roads reserved for settlers. He does say a viable state could still be salvageable, though, through negotiation and land swaps, but only with serious engagement from the countries now prepared to recognize a Palestinian state. Now, he says, not tomorrow. Husseini, the lawyer in Ramallah, believes the international community must be prepared to introduce economic sanctions against Israel if it doesn't change course. \"When you are allowing hundreds of thousands and millions in Gaza to go hungry under the watchful eyes of the world, I think this requires some significant steps.\" Husseini believes the only way forward for both Israelis and Palestinians is the two-state solution. \"The Palestinians are not going to go away. The Israelis are not going to go away. And we have to find a way,\" she said. \"It seems far-fetched today because the conflict has raged for so long and because the animosity is at a very heightened level and there is so much distrust. But we're hopeful. That's why we continue to work on it.\"",

        "story": "Bernie Parent, the Hall of Famer considered one of the great goalies of all time who anchored the net for the Philadelphia Flyers' only two Stanley Cup championships in the 1970s during their Broad Street Bullies heyday, has died. He was 80. The Flyers made the announcement Sunday but provided no details. Parent died overnight in his sleep, former teammate Joe Watson said. Watson, a star defenceman on the Stanley Cup teams, said by phone that he saw Parent and other former Flyers players at a function Friday night in Delaware. \"Bernie was in such pain, he could hardly walk,\" Watson said, citing Parent's bad back. \"We had a great time, but I felt bad because he was in such terrible pain. To see this happen, it's very sad.\" Parent's steel-eyed stare through his old-school hockey mask landed him on the cover of Time magazine in 1975 when the Flyers reigned as one of the marquee teams in sports.The Montreal nativewon Stanley Cup, Conn Smythe and Vezina trophies in back-to-back seasons when the Flyers captured the Stanley Cup in `74 and '75, the first NHL expansion team to win the championship. \"The legend of Bernie Parent reached far beyond the ice and his accolades,\" the Flyers said in a statement. \"Bernie had a deep love for Philadelphia and fans of the Flyers. He was passionate about his role as an ambassador for Ed Snider Youth Hockey & Education and inspired an entire generation of hockey fans. He dedicated his time, energy and enthusiasm to not only grow the game, but also to spread joy to anyone he encountered.\" The Flyers and Ed Snider Youth Hockey &amp; Education are heartbroken to learn of the passing of Bernie Parent, a true legend, one of the most famous and beloved players, and most popular figures in the history of the organization and city of Philadelphia. <a href=\"https://t.co/Od28lVQHK8\">https://t.co/Od28lVQHK8</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/4o3VQZFO1t\">pic.twitter.com/4o3VQZFO1t</a> After he made his NHL debut with Boston in 1965, Parent was left unprotected by the Bruins in the 1967 expansion draft and was selected by the Flyers. After 3 1/2 seasons, he was traded to Toronto but ended up back in Philadelphia ahead of the 1973-74 season. He won a league-high 47 games that season and led the NHL in wins again the next season with 44. Parent was accidentally struck in the right eye with a stick in 1979 and was temporarily blinded. He never played again, retiring with 271 wins — 231 of them for the Flyers — over a 13-year career. \"At his unbeatable, unflappable best on the ice when the stakes were highest, Bernie was a warm, gregarious bear of a man off the ice who was venerated in Philadelphia and adored throughout the hockey world,\" Commissioner Gary Bettman said. \"The entire National Hockey League family mourns the passing of this beloved icon and sends its deepest condolences to his wife, Gini, his family, and his countless fans and friends.\" The Flyers beat the Bruins in six games to win the Stanley Cup in 1974 and beat Buffalo in 1975. Parent had shutouts in the clinchers each season. On the flight home from Buffalo, the Flyers plopped the Stanley Cup in the middle of the aisle. For close to 90 minutes, they couldn't take their eyes off hockey's ultimate prize. \"We were able to just sit back, look at the Stanley Cup and just savour it,\" Parent said in 2010. \"It was just a special time.\" With Parent the unstoppable force in net, \"Only the Lord saves more than Bernie Parent,\" became a popular slogan in Philadelphia that stuck with him through the decades. Parent, team captain Bobby Clarke and Dave \"The Hammer\" Schultz all became stars for the Flyers under owner Ed Snider in an era when the team was known for its rugged style of play that earned the Bullies nickname. They embraced their moniker as the most despised team in the NHL and pounded their way into the hearts of Flyers fans. More than 2 million fans packed Philadelphia streets for each of their championship parades. \"We always felt comfortable with Bernie in the net,\" former Flyers winger and enforcer Bob Kelly said. \"He would challenge the guys in practice. He'd stop the puck and throw it back at you and say, `go ahead, try and catch this one.' He was the first guy to jump in line to help another teammate if they needed it. He was a real testament to what a team player is all about.\" Parent's No. 1 jersey was retired by the Flyers and still hangs in the rafters of their arena. In 1984 he became the first Flyers player inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He is still the Flyers' career leader in shutouts with 50. Parent remained connected with the team over the years as an ambassador. \"He was so good with people,\" said Watson, who first met Parent in 1963. \"A lot of athletes don't get it or don't give fans the time of day. Bernie gave everyone the time of day. He'd always have his rings on. He'd show them to the people and people loved to see them. This past Friday in Delaware, people were coming up, they wanted to see the rings. People were so excited to see him. He had a great sense of humour. Bernie was a funny guy.\" The final career highlight came in 2011 when Parent was in the net for an alumni game outdoors at the baseball stadium Citizens Bank Park ahead of the NHL Classic. \"Bernie! Bernie! Bernie!\" echoed throughout the park for the affable goalie, who played 5 minutes, 32 seconds and stopped all six shots. Each save made the \"Bernie!\" chants return. \"He was a man who was always happy, always laughing and was always fun to be around,\" Clarke said. \"He did what all great hockey players do: He played for the hockey team. The two years that we won the Stanley Cup, he was the only member of that team that we could not have been without if we were going to win. He was the best goalie in hockey for those two years.\" Parent was the third Hall of Fame goaltender to die this month. Ken Dryden, who helped the Montreal Canadiens win six Stanley Cup titles in the 1970s,died at 78 after a fight with cancer. Ed Giacomin, one of the faces of the New York Rangers' franchise in the 1960s and '70s,died at 86 of natural causes. \"They're big losses,\" Kelly said. \"They were just prime, super goaltenders.\"",

        "story": "Canadian sprinters Aaron Brown, Jerome Blake, Brendon Rodney and Andre De Grasse picked up a second straight global championship medal in the rain, capturing silver in the world 100-metre relay on Sunday in Tokyo. Anchor De Grasse battled Noah Lyles down the home stretch, but the American pulled away over the final metres to reach the finish line in a world-leading 37.29 seconds at Japan National Stadium. Canada posted a season-best 37.55, with the Netherlands taking bronze in a national record 37.81. The Canadian mark is 37.48, set by Brown, Blake, Rodney and De Grasse in their 2022 winning performance at worlds in Eugene, Ore. \"Congrats to [the U.S.] but I still feel like we're a team that can win gold,\" Brown told Devin Heroux of CBC Sports. \"We're happy with a silver but we know there is more there.\" Canada, which also won Olympic gold last summer in less-than-ideal race conditions, won its heat on Saturday in 37.85, finishing ahead of the U.S. WATCH | Canada clocks season-best 37.55 seconds for men's 100m relay silver in Tokyo: Canadian men close world championships with 4x100m relay silver medal \"I didn't get to show [the Canadian sprinters] who USA was. It's [going to be] fun in Beijing [at the 2027 worlds],\" said Lyles, who will also leave Tokyo with 100 bronze and 200 gold from these world championships. WATCH | Bednarek on the win: 'We came here with a goal in mind and handled business:' USA who? Americans get the last laugh over Canadians in world championship 4x100m relay final Sporting a crown on his head, Lyles said Sunday's effort proves the Americans are the best in the world. \"Noah, it was you who said, 'Canada who?' leading into the Olympics, then Canada beats you, and now you don't remember you actually started this beef,\" countered Trackside co-host, Perdita Felicien. CBC Sports analyst Donovan Bailey believes Lyles's words should \"light a fire under the Canadians\" in the relay and, more importantly, the individual athletes. \"We've got to get guys back in the 100-metre final.\" Coleman added Sunday's race outcome felt \"like a relief because we know we're supposed to [win].\" 'No answer for the speed of the Americans' \"Canada has nothing to hang their heads at,\" she added. \"Their [baton] exchanges were clean. They just did not have an answer for the speed of the Americans.\" WATCH | Donovan Bailey says Canada's men were 'lucky and incredible' in how they ran: World Athletics Championships day 9 reaction with Donovan Bailey There was a great opportunity for Canada to capture gold 24 hours after powerhouses South Africa and Jamaica were DQ'd in the heats, along with Great Britain and Italy, for botching the handover of the baton. De Grasse praised Brown for a \"great\" pre-race speech Sunday. \"We're happy with the performance, almost a national record,\" he said. \"We're consistent. We've won [five medals at global championships] since 2015 [bronze at worlds in Beijing]. I'm grateful to be part of it.\" 7x 🥇🥇🥈🥈🥉🥉🥉<br><br>The relay dynasty continues 🇨🇦 <br><br>Thank you Tokyo 🇯🇵 <a href=\"https://t.co/vsMrrg4JgF\">pic.twitter.com/vsMrrg4JgF</a> Blake joined the team in time for its 2021 Olympic silver behind Italy at Japan National Stadium. Two years ago, the Canadian men did not qualify for the world final in Budapest, Hungary, where De Grasse skipped the heats and his replacement, Bolade Ajomale, struggled badly down the stretch. Earlier this week, De Grasse wondered if Tokyo would be the farewell appearance for him, Brown, Blake and Rodney as a team. \"The younger guys are coming,\" De Grasse said. \"We have good alternates. Eliezer [Adjibi] just ran in the [world] 100m this year and we have Duan [Asemota] who won the Canadian [title on Aug. 1 in Ottawa]. I know those guys are hungry to get on the team.\" WATCH | 'We're going to continue delivering medals,\" Rodney says of his teammates: Canadian relay team 'cherish' world championship silver medal in what might be their final run together Bailey said keeping the 'old men' together was a great call by Athletics Canada head coach Glenroy Gilbert, with whom he won 1996 Olympic relay gold in Atlanta. \"I did say I would mix it up,\" Bailey reminded viewers after Sunday's race. \"Isn't it such an easy way for me to motivate the team? … These guys have done phenomenal. Congratulations to the U.S. team and the Canadian team.\" De Grasse added: \"So many great memories. I think all of us are going to cherish this moment. Obviously, we're a little bit disappointed but when we look back at it, we're going to be grateful and happy we came together. We've done this at such a high level for a long time. \"Amazing run and we look forward to worlds again in Beijing in 2027.\" WATCH l Full replay coverage of Sunday's action at Japan National Stadium: World Athletics Championships Tokyo 25: Day 9 evening session U.S. tops Jamaica for women's relay gold Earlier Sunday, the Canadian women's 4x100m team, fresh off a national record 42.38 in Saturday's heats, went 42.82 for seventh in the final. The U.S. captured gold in 41.75, followed by Jamaica (41.79 season best) and Germany (41.87). At the World Relays in May, Sade McCreath, Jacqueline Madogo, Marie-Éloïse Leclair and Audrey Leduc was fifth. Canada also appeared in the Olympic final a year ago in Paris, placing sixth in the rain. \"We're all out here in the same weather,\" said McCreath, \"so you can't let it be a distraction.\" On Sunday, Madogo told Heroux the team's first world final was a \"great experience\" and its time to medal at worlds will come. \"We're a very young team and we're building momentum,\" she said. Leclair said it is \"inspiring' racing with McCreath, Madogo and Leduc. \"I hope [the team] can inspire other people, other girls in Canada,\" Leclair said. 'I felt like I ran with my heart' Sha'Carri Richardson saved the day for the Americans on a day track bid a hug-filled farewell to Jamaican sprint legend, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce. \"I felt like I ran with my heart because of the ladies I'm standing with,\" Richardson said, as she celebrated her first gold medal of a championships that was far from perfect. \"I feel really good. It came back. I'm ready to start all over again.\" It has been a tough, injury-tainted year for Richardson, who finished fifth last weekend in the women's 100. Even so, the U.S. put her on the anchor leg for the 4x100 relay — same place she's been for gold-medal performances the last two years — and she didn't disappoint. But unlike last year at the Olympics, when she gave the side-eye to the opponents she passed, then stomped her foot for emphasis at the finish line, she had to run hard all the way through in this one. Richardson was trailing by 1-100th of a second when she received the baton from Kayla White. It took a few steps for her to build a lead of her own, and she held off Jonielle Smith down the stretch and leaned in for the win. It was a 4-100ths margin, and the difference might have been a slight hiccup in an exchange between Jamaican twins Tia and Tina Clayton. It was Richardson's comeback that turned Melissa Jefferson-Wooden, who ran the lead leg, into the first three-time sprint winner at worlds —100, 200 and relay — since Fraser-Pryce did it in 2013. It also left the Jamaican they call the \"Mommy Rocket\" with silver, the same colour she won in her debut at worlds, back in 2007 in Osaka when she was 20 and earned a spot on the foursome that ran the qualifying round. \"No emotions right now,\" Fraser-Pryce said. \"Just grateful to be able to finish this race. It's been such a remarkable moment.\" Jefferson-Wooden wasn't alone in seeking out Fraser-Pryce, whose medal was her 17th from world championships to go with eight from the Olympics, mostly to say \"thanks.\" \"She's definitely paved the way for women's short sprints and it's so inspiring to see someone like her do what she did and be so dominant for so long,\" Jefferson-Wooden said. \"All of us up here are aspiring to do the same things.\" The U.S. won 26 overall medals at these worlds, the same number they captured in the same stadium four years ago at the Tokyo Olympics. Only seven were gold that time. Canada will leave Japan with five medals, including gold by hammer throwers Ethan Katzberg and Camryn Rogers, along with Evan Dunfee in the race walk. The Canadian team brought home six medals two years ago from Budapest, Hungary, trailingits eight-medal outburst in 2015 in Beijing. Hocker returns to track, wins men's 5,000m American Cole Hocker came to world championships hoping for two medals. He was only allowed to run for one, and when he won that one Sunday, it felt pretty good. Hocker, who rose to track fame by winning the Olympic 1,500 last year with an inside charge past the two favourites, got disqualified from that event this week while running the same line in qualifying. Back on the track for the 5,000, he took to the outside lane for the closing kick and nobody could stop him from there. Hocker sprinted past a bunched-up group including Isaac Kimeli and 10,000 champ Jimmy Gressier to win in what has been his better race this year, even though he felt he could contend in both. \"Of course I wanted to see how I could do in two events, and I felt like one event was taken from me and I didn't get to show my potential,\" said Hocker, whose winning time was 12 minutes 58.30 seconds. \"Not getting to do that in the 1,500 really hurt. But then I got to do that in the 5,000, and I knew that was the only way I was going to redeem myself.\" For more stories about the experiences of Black Canadians — from anti-Black racism to success stories within the Black community — check out Being Black in Canada, a CBC project Black Canadians can be proud of.You can read more stories here.",

        "story": "Alexandre Hayward knew as he pedalled along the cobblestone streets of Ronse, Belgium, that he was going to have a time trial to be proud of. \"I've had a really good year,\" the New Brunswicker said. \"I knew I was in really good shape, and I knew this year, more than any, [there] was definitely a possibility to win.\" The 28-year-old from Quispamsis was at the top of his game going into the international competition on Aug. 29, despite dealing with a sore back and a bad night's sleep the night before. \"I was pretty confident I was going to be on the podium — and then, when I came through the finish, I heard it on the loudspeaker.\" Haywardhad just won the time-trial gold medalat the men's C3 Para cycling world championships. The feeling? \"It's just extremely cool,\" said Hayward, a smile creeping onto his face as he looked back on the race. \"It's hard to put into words, honestly.\" From unable to walk to crossing the finish line: N.B. cyclist becomes world champion The 23.2-kilometre time trial, a race in which the athletes compete against the clock individually, took Hayward only 30 minutes and six seconds. But he'd spent three years preparing for the race, after first taking up Para cycling during the COVID-19 lockdown. \"I kind of went to the bike, like a lot of people did during the pandemic, and things snowballed quite quickly from there,\" he said. But Hayward's route to the world title had its origins in something that happened much earlier. In 2012, when he was in Grade 9, he was an up-and-coming Quismpamsis hockey player taking part in a tournament in Quebec City and thinking a lot about the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. \"You know, we were starting to talk about QMJHL drafts and things like that,\" Hayward said. \"That was kind of the dream for me, was to play in the QMJHL somewhere.\" But during that tournament, Hayward made contact with another player and fell, his neck bending back so far that his teammate said his head actually touched his back. The resulting spinal cord injury left Hayward struggling to breathe at first. He was told he might be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. \"The scariest thing for me was maybe not ever getting to play sports again,\" he said. But each day, he gained back some ability, working with staff at the Stan Cassidy Centre for Rehabilitation in Fredericton. \"Luckily enough for me, I was kind of miraculously able to walk out of Stan Cassidy six months after my injury.\" Gearing up Hayward began playing wheelchair basketball in the first few years after his injury, as he continued to deal with its impact on his mobility, but it was when he discovered Para cycling that something clicked. \"I didn't need to use some kind of special modified thing to keep up, which was the first time that had happened since my injury,\" he said. \"That's when I started thinking a little bit more seriously about it, mostly just because I was having so much fun and kind of feeling like an able-bodied person again for the first time.\" In the lead-up to the 2024 Paralympic Games in Paris, where he won a bronze medal, Hayward moved to Bromont, Que., to train full time with Cycling Canada's Paralympic team under lead coach Sébastien Travers. \"Alex is a quick learner, and he's an engineer, so he has a really good thought process and analysis process,\" Travers said. He said Hayward started out as a rookie, but it didn't take long for his trajectory to change. \"Alex knows that it's not just about the engine; it's about how you drive the bike, how about you manage your effort,\" Travers said. \"So he is becoming more of a complete athlete who can execute a plan, not just pedal hard and hope for the best.\" Breaking through barriers Thirteen years after his injury, Hayward appears on the surface to be an able-bodied athlete. \"Any time I tell somebody I've gone to the Paralympics, they ask me why, and why they let me compete with the others,\" he said. \"So I think it's a pretty neat opportunity to open people's eyes to the idea that not everybody who has a disability, it's super visible, and that people that go to the Paralympics aren't necessarily all people in wheelchairs or people who are visibly missing a limb.\" Hayward still faces challenges because of his injury: a lack of normal sensation from his collarbone down, and spasticity of tone — meaning he can have difficulty moving his muscles quickly. \"That's just a small price to pay, all things considered,\" he said. After the Paralympics in 2024, Hayward achieved something else he's always wanted to do. And it's not an athletic achievement. \"It just started making more and more sense to me to come back to New Brunswick,\" he said. \"I'd always had this dream, probably since Grade 10 or 11, that I realized I wanted to start saving money for a house.\" He has just bought that house, and is working for a local construction company as a mechanical engineer. He said he's always felt proud to be from New Brunswick, and is looking forward to a better work-life-sports balance. \"In the last decade, I haven't lived in the same place for more than 18 months. So I'm looking forward to a little more stability.\" Between now and the next race season kicking off in spring 2026, Hayward says he's going to compete in some local events, and re-root himself in Quispamsis. \"The most important thing right now for me is probably trying to figure out what colour I'm gonna paint my kitchen,\" he added.",

        "story": "At a large warehouse full of roaring recycling machines, Chloé Dubois stands beside a sack full of thousands of tiny plastic pellets. Previously fishing ropes and nets, the pellets are now giving new life to marine plastic waste choking the oceans that surround Canada. Dubois is the co-founder and executive director of the Ocean Legacy Foundation, a British Columbia non-profit that operates what it calls Canada's first marine waste recycling program. \"Plastic pollution is one of the biggest challenges facing our time,\" she said. \"We really need to conserve the biodiversity we have in Canada as well as internationally. So we really need to be better at managing these materials.\" But now, government cuts are putting the program at risk. While Ocean Legacy gets some revenue from selling those pellets to plastics manufacturers, it has also relied on money from provincial and federal ocean cleanup projects, such as theGhost GearFundrun by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO). Those funding streams were not renewed this year. \"It's impacted Ocean Legacy but also the entire community that's involved in ocean cleanup,\" said Dubois. \"A lot of other organizations have had to lay people off.\" The ghost gear problem Abandoned, lost or discarded fishing gear — also called \"ghost gear\" — is considered to be aleading causeof marine animal deaths. Worldwide, about 640,000 tons of gear are left in oceans every year, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. It can stay in oceans for hundreds of years and small whales, seals, sea lions, turtles and fish can get entangled in the nets or ropes and suffocate or starve. Humpback whale freed after 2 weeks entangled in fishing gear While marine plastic waste is collected across Canada and dropped off at depots, Dubois wanted it to be repurposed. \"There is a pretty big gap in the supply chain where a lot of manufacturers don't know how to use recycled content or it's too expensive,\" Dubois said. How it works Outside the facility sits a mountain of discarded fishing nets, rope and other materials. Ocean Legacy gets the waste — about 800 to 1,000 tonnes per year — from its own cleanups and from community partners. The waste is then sorted, melted and diced into pellets which are sold to manufacturers who are then able to make new products, including patio furniture, flower pots and boards that resemble lumber. Robert James Pierson, co-founder and CEO of the leadership team at Raiiz Innovations Inc., a sustainable home building company, said he wants builders to use the boards in home construction. \"Construction has such a bad reputation for the amounts of material that goes into landfills. We should be recycling so much more of the materials,\" he told CBC News. Some objects like fishing rope only need to be sorted, washed and shredded before they can be used to make new products, according to Dubois. \"So there's a lot of different variety in terms of what we can do with the plastics and how we apply them into new product design and production,\" she said. Ocean Legacy collects marine plastics from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and wants to one day open a recycling facility on the East Coast. \"It's important to expand these types of marine recovery plastic programs from coast to coast because this is a national problem and it's not going away,\" Dubois said. Funding cuts The problem is, crucial provincial and federal government support to clean up ocean garbage has gone away. From 2019 to 2024, DFO dedicated over $58 million to fund 143 projects across the country to clean up and repurpose ghost gear. But the department told CBC News there was no funding for 2025. \"DFO will continue to engage Indigenous harvesters, the fishing industry and other partners and stakeholders on how to prevent and address ghost gear in Canada into the future,\" it said in a statement. Similarly, no future funding has been identified for B.C.'sClean Coast, Clean Watersinitiative past 2024. The province said over 2,100 tons of marine debris were removed since the program began in 2020. \"We remain committed to protecting our province's shorelines from debris and plastic pollution, so they can be enjoyed for generations to come,\"the B.C. Ministry of Environment and Parks said in a statement. Dubois said without funding from those programs, her organization is bringing in less than 50 percent of what it needs to sustain operations. She said there is a risk of losing experienced staff that have trained for years to do specialized cleanup and restoration work. Dubois said Ocean Legacy is now looking to diversify its revenue streams, potentially offering tug and barge services or online education. And even at full capacity, some environmentalists like Anthony Merante with Oceana Canada, a charity devoted to ocean conservation, say plastic recycling is only scratching the surface. \"The reality is, if we don't stop plastic production, if we don't stop wasting so much plastic and generating so much plastic waste, it's just going to always be cleaning up a mess that we're constantly making,\" Merante said in an interview. \"So we need strong regulations to get rid of a lot of the unnecessary single-use plastics that we have just filling our lives.\"",

        "story": "The next time Mississauga residents want to complain about a dead raccoon on their street, they could discover a brand new selection of local musicians. The city's Music 311 program is making a comeback for the sixth year, with 12 songs to be selected to play for callers while they're waiting on the line. The call-out is out for new artists. And Gaby Al Botros, whose songMistwas selected last year, has one main piece of advice for those applying: \"Pick a soft, calming song,\" he said. \"It's not annoying when you're waiting.\" The classical guitarist and composer moved to Canada from Syria as part of the Artist Protection Fund, a program run by the American non-profit Institute of International Education that helps threatened artists get out of dangerous regions. Having called Mississauga home for four years now, he said it's exciting to have so many others in the city discover his music. Mississauga's 311 contact centre received 225,365 calls last year, according to the city, and 175,965 in 2025 so far. The city did not say how long its average 311 wait-time is. \"That is actually a very good exposure for me as a musician,\" Al Botros said in an interview. Pop musician Shanaya Patel also had her songAugust Twenty-Secondpicked last year. \"It was something that I honestly hadn't thought of before in terms of marketing or promotion or even connecting with people in that way,\" Patel said, reflecting on how she's discovered songs during mundane moments like eating at a restaurant. \"I love when those moments happen. So it's so great to maybe create that moment for someone else,\" she said. Music 'as diverse as Mississauga itself' Hold music can resonate with people. Just have a look at the comment section for theTim Carleton songOpus No. 1, which will be familiar to anyone who's been put on hold before. Mississauga took inspiration from other citieslike Torontoto start the music program, according to Corey Poole, a co-ordinator with Mississauga's music program development. Since the program started, he says city staff received calls from residents who wanted to find out what songs they listened to while on hold. Given its success, he said they also started playing the songs across other channels, like the livestreams of city council as viewers wait for meetings to start. Each artist selected for the program gets $300 for a one-year term. \"This is just one of the ways that we can help create paid opportunities for them, while also showcasing the top-notch talent,\" Poole said. He said each year, the 12 finalists are selected by a panel of members in the local music industry who are looking for music \"as diverse as Mississauga itself.\" \"We accept music with lyrics in any language. We accept music of all different genres and styles. Of course, we just ask that it be completely family-friendly,\" he said. Applications close Sept. 28, with those selected publicly announced in January. If groups apply, at least 50 per cent of members have to be local to Mississauga.",

        "story": "Canadian politicians and experts are pushing back against U.S. ambassador Pete Hoekstra's frustration over the anti-American sentiment he's seen in Canada after U.S. President Donald Trump hit the world with tariffs. \"When you kick the dog, you can't blame it for snarling back,\" said Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association and member of the prime minister's Canada-U.S. relations council. \"It's gaslighting 101,\" Volpe added. \"You probably should get someone to tell him a little bit more about how to properly do Canada-U.S. diplomacy, but I'm not sure he'd listen.\" On Thursday, Hoekstra said at an event hosted by the Halifax Chamber of Commerce he's \"disappointed that I came to Canada — a Canada that it is very, very difficult to find Canadians who are passionate about the American-Canadian relationship.\" \"You ran a campaign where it was anti-American, elbows up, me too. You know, that was an anti-American campaign. That has continued. That's disappointing,\" Hoekstra said. U.S. ambassador 'disappointed' Canadians aren't 'passionate' about their relationship with Americans Volpe said Hoekstra \"knows exactly what he's doing when he makes those statements.… This is his style. I don't know what his objective is, but maybe his audience is actually in Washington rather than across this country.\" \"I try to ignore his rhetoric,\" Volpe said. Stephen Marche, a Canadian novelist and host of theGloves Offpodcast, told CBC'sThe Housethat Hoekstra \"is the person you send to a country to alienate it. He is a person who obviously has no interest in maintaining really decent U.S.-Canadian relations.\" \"I think we need to steadily ignore him,\" Marche added, echoing Volpe's sentiments. Canadians will react to attacks, says Andrew Scheer In an interview onRosemary Barton Livethat airs Sunday morning, Conservative House Leader Andrew Scheer said any time a foreign country slaps tariffs or raises the idea of annexation, \"of course Canadians are going to react negatively to that.\" \"We are different, we are distinct. I don't like to define Canada in the negative. I like to define Canada in the positive,\" Scheer told host Rosemary Barton. \"We're more than just not being American. We have a proud history.\" On Thursday, Hoekstra also pointed to a Canadian cabinet minister's \"war\" references as not helping relations between the two countries. Finance Minister Fran\u0000çois-Philippe Champagne used the word \"war\" multiple times this week while talking about how Canada is trying to re-invent the Canadian economy like it did back in 1945 after the Second World War. \"We've been there during the war when it came to aluminum, we've been there during the war when it came to steel,\" Champagne told reporters. \"We've been there during the war when it came to work together with American friends and allies.\" Hoekstra fired back saying using such language is \"a dangerous place to go.\" When asked for his thoughts on Hoekstra's comments, Champagne struck a diplomatic tone and told Barton \"the tariffs have been impacting a number of works and sectors in Canada like we have not seen in a very long time or ever.\" Reaction to U.S. ambassador being 'disappointed' with anti-American sentiment in Canada \"So obviously this is deeply felt in Canada…. I think [Hoekstra] understands that Canadians have felt sad with what has happened. But at the same time, I'm sure he understands how much we have done together and will continue to do together.\" Hoekstra defended Trump's tariffs by saying countries competing with Canada to sell products to the U.S. are facing higher rates. \"Your relative position has improved,\" he said. \"And you, your cabinet describes this as a relationship that America has turned its back on.\" In response, Volpe said, \"I unfortunately only speak English and I don't understand what he's saying there. Everybody was better off nine months ago, including Canada.\" \"Maybe because he wasn't the ambassador nine months ago he didn't know that, but he'd be hard-pressed to find anybody who has any relationship with data to agree with him.\"",

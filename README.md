Keep updated with new summaries

## Project Description
AINewsSummarization is a tool/application designed to automatically gather news articles and generate concise summaries using AI‑powered techniques. It enables users to stay informed by providing distilled versions of news stories, saving time and highlighting key points. The project integrates a backend (Python) for fetching and summarizing and a frontend (TypeScript/HTML/CSS) for user interaction, and supports deployment via Docker.
